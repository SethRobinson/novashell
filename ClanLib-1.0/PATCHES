Due to the modest volume of patches we get and because all recent patches that
have come in are rather hairy, here is a summary of how to create patches for ClanLib.

Diffing
===================================
Use 'diff -u > mypatch.patch' or 'svn diff > mypatch.patch' from within
the ClanLib (trunk) directory. This is contextual diff, it provides more
information so it easier to examine the changes before applying.

If you're using Windows, the TortoiseSVN utility
(http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) can easily create patches. Right click
your ClanLib directory (or trunk), and select TortoiseSVN->Create Patch.

Submitting
===================================
Please submit patches to our Developer Chat section on the forums:
http://www.rtsoft.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=16

Describing
===================================
You should describe what your patch does. Please no 'This fixes a bug'.
Tell us which bug, in what component. Generally, be descriptive without
being needless verbose.
