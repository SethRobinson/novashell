<p>You need to use a 256 color bitmap. You may draw the letters in any order,
but keep in mind that colors with indexes 253, 254, 255 are reserved.</p>

<p>A typical font would look like this:</p>

<p><img src="Images/font_old0.png"</p>

<p>From this, one can deduce the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>color 255 is used as an "horizontal delimiter" (the white lines).</li>
<li>color 254 is used as a "vertical delimiter" (the green lines).</li>
<li>color 253 is used as a "carriage return" (the dark red lines), when one needs to define a font on several lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>Save your file as a 256 coloured PCX. Note that Photoshop strangely moves index
colours 253, 254, 255 to index 1,2 and 3. Don't ask why :)</p>
