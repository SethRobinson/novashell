      Summary: Resource manager, user-defined resources

This example is intended to provide information about:
 * using non-surfaces resources (string, int, boolean, etc) ...
   since the surface resources is very much used in other examples
 * user-defined resources; if you want to create your own resource types,
   and loading these using the XML Dom model.
