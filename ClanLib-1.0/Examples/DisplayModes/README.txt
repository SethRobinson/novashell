      Summary: Get a list over available display modes.
      
This shows all available display modes, with width, height and refreshrate (if available).
It shows it in a GUI, where the user can select a resolution, and switch to it.

Note: The resolution switching has been disabled because we've experienced some
      trouble with fullscreen.
