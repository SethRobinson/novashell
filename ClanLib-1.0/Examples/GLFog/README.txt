      Summary: GL

Fog is a small OpenGL application that was used in a
FlipCode contest which have ported it to ClanLib.

Music-code was not ported.

Many thanks to Johan Glysing for his code.

Original README is below (which is specific for
Windows), and contains some info on keyboard commands.

FOG/SMOKE V1.2 - FLIPCODE CONTEST - WWW.FLIPCODE.COM
----------------------------------------------------------

==UPDATES===

- Runs smoother
- More light sources



==INFO======

Coded for the March programming contest at Flipcode.

This entry was made with openGL and was written in Visual C++ 5.0.
I would recommend that you use opengl32.dll to get hardware acceleration
if this runs slowly. Then copy the opengl32.dll file to the program folder
and run it again.

Right now im not doing much so if you want me to code something for you,
then contact me and ask... some kind of payment would be appriciated.



==KEYS======

UP/DOWN ARROWS		- Change the movement patterns <-- Try this

LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS	- Change the global fog color

F1			- Auto change fog modes and colors every 25th second.

F2			- Start/Stop the music

F3			- Change the number of lights. (3, 6, or 10)

F12			- Fullscreen if you are in windowed mode. Dont
			  use this if you started 640x480.bat
