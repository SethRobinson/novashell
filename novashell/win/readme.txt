I understand that this is beta software and could contain bugs and other nastyness that could reduce my computer into a smoldering heap of melted plastic.

I won't fly to Japan and kick Seth's ass in the event of the above happening.

I won't distribute this beta software to others.

I understand that this version has features missing and poor, if any, documentation.

If I'm a casual user that doesn't want to be frustrated, I understand that I should just wait for a real release version.
