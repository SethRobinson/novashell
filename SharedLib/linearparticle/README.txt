 LinearParticle 0.50
============================================================================
LinearParticle is an easy-to-use 2D particle library for Clanlib. It's
simple and small but powerful enough to be used to make eye candy 2D
visual effects for games. No graphical particle system editor is available
yet. LinearParticle 0.50 has been tested to work with Clanlib 0.8.0, if you
are using it with earlier version of Clanlib, you might encounter some
integration problems.



============================================================================
 Building/Installing LinearParticle
============================================================================
To build LinearParticle lib, you need to have Clanlib installed in your
system, no other dependencies. Before compiling the examples, GFrameHandler
lib (the source code has been included) need to be builded.

Preprocessor symbols for configuring LinearParticle :

-- L_USING_DOUBLE -- 
By default, LinearParticle uses float precision real numbers calculations.
If you want LinearParticle to perform calculations with double precision,
define "L_USING_DOUBLE" before building LinearParticle lib.

-- L_DEBUG_MODE --
Define this preprocessor symbol before building LinearParticle in debug mode.


Current version of LinearParticle comes with Code::Blocks workspace file,
Code::Blocks users can just open the project file to build LinearParticle
lib and examples (using float precision by default). Non-Code::Blocks users
unfortunately need to speed little more time to set up a workspace/project
file or writing makefile to build the library and examples.

If you are using MingW32, you can skip the step to build LinearParticle and
download the precompiled library from LinearParticle webpage.
