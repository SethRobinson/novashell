      Summary: Getting mouse input through polling.
      
This example uses the old way of checking for mouse button presses - through polling.
Mousewheel and extra buttons are not supported with this method.
Check out the MouseSignal example using signals for such features.

If you click anywhere in the window, a message on the console screen will appear stating
what button you pressed and where.
