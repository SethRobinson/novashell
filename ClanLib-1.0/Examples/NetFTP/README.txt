      Summary: sockets, ftp

This is meant to be a demonstration of ClanLib for practical purposes as well as
demonstrate sockets. 

NetFTP is meant to eventually be a usable FTP server.  Currently it supports:
- Anonymous users only
- Single user at a time 
- File transfers

It's not much, but it is improving. If you want to implement a network protocol
without the builtin types and classes then you should look at this sourcecode.

After running this program you can connect to port 2021 on your local machine and
see that it works.
