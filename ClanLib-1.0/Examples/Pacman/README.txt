      Summary: Complete pacman game

This is the game that started it all. Before time there was pacman.
Pacman even existed before Windows did. And before ClanLib.

It also happens to be the very first example for ClanLib, using a
variant of Pacman available on the Apple IIe that one of the authors
of ClanLib loved to play when he was a little kid. Can you guess
the name of the game its inspired from?
