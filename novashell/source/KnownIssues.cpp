Section: Known Issues
There are a few things that can bite you in the ass if you aren't careful, those are listed here.

Removing path nodes can confuse warp targets:

If path nodes are removed that connected two warp targets, the engine won't realize it and will still show them connected.

Only 32 bit mode supported:

By default the game will play fullscreen at 32 bit bitdepth.  But if you play windowed and your display is set at 16 bit, the map thumbnails will be blank.

OSX Specific:

There is currently no joystick support under OSX.  Seth needs to add this to Clanlib or something.
