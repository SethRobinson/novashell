<title>ClanLib - Overview</title>

<body>

<p>The overview section is a walkthrough of many of ClanLib's components,
classes and interfaces. It is highly adviceable to read it from the one end
to the other, if you want to get a proper overview of what ClanLib can do
for you.</p>

<p>The ClanLib game SDK is a library that can ease your game development in
many ways. ClanLib has APIs for 2D graphics, 3D graphics, sound, network,
I/O, input, GUI and resource administration. ClanLib reads a number of
common image formats, either natively or through third-party libraries
supported by ClanLib. ClanLib provides transparent support for OpenGL, so
that you can use native OpenGL commands while letting ClanLib handle the
boring parts such as window management, sound, networking and all the other
things that are required to make a good game besides 3D graphics.</p>

<p>We will assume you're familiar with C++, and basic game programming
terminology. If you're just starting out on making games, perhaps you should
first look at a few of the numerous sites that describe game programming in
general.</p>

<p>If there is something you think is missing out in the documentation, please add a
comment to the page most relevant to the information you are seeking. We
will then when reviewing the documentation update it based on user
requests.</p>
